## Introduction
This project is a React-based application that integrates with GrapesJS, a versatile open-source web builder framework. GrapesJS provides a powerful and flexible platform for building and managing web content visually. This project aims to demonstrate how to effectively use GrapesJS within a React application to create a dynamic and user-friendly web content editor.

## Features
- **Visual Editor**: Drag and drop functionality to create and manage web components.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your web pages look great on all devices.
- **Custom Components**: Extend and customize GrapesJS components to suit your needs.
- **React Integration**: Seamless integration of GrapesJS with a React application.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/grapesjs-react-project.git
    cd grapesjs-react-project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will start the development server and you can view the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the GrapesJS editor by navigating to the specified route in your React application. Use the drag-and-drop interface to build and design web pages. You can add, edit, and style components directly within the editor.

## Customization
You can customize the GrapesJS editor by modifying the configuration and adding custom components. The main configuration is located in the `Editor.jsx` file. Here you can define plugins, block manager settings, and other customization options.
